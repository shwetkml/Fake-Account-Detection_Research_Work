It is a research work on "Detection of Fake accounts in LinkedIn" using various machine learning models.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AIM & OBJECTIVES

1. To detect fake profiles on LinkedIn that are created with the intention of spamming, phishing.

2. To prevent cyber crimes such as identity theft and data breaches by identifying and removing fake profiles.

3. To analyze user behavior and detect abnormal activities using machine learning models, such as multi-layer neural network model, random forest model, XG boost      model, and LSTM model.

ALGORITHMS 

1.  Artificial Neural Network:- An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computational model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It is a form of machine learning that enables computers to learn and make predictions or decisions based on input data.

2.  Random Forest :- Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that combines the power of multiple decision trees to make accurate predictions. It is called "random" because it creates an ensemble of trees and makes decisions based on the majority vote or average prediction of these trees.

3.  XG Booster:- XGBoost, short for Extreme Gradient Boosting, is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is widely used for both regression and classification tasks. It is an optimized implementation of the gradient boosting framework, which is a popular ensemble learning technique.

4.  LSTM:-  Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is particularly effective in handling and analyzing sequential data. It is designed to capture and remember long-term dependencies and patterns in data over extended periods.

CONCLUSION

The study used machine learning methods, including Neural Network, Random Forest, and ANN, to detect fake LinkedIn profiles based on visible data.
After training and testing the models on the MIB data set, XG Boost achieved the highest accuracy of 95.22%, followed by Neural Network and Random Forest.
